# The Vending Machine Kata

## Requirements

The following are needed in advance to run the Vending Machine:

* Python 2.7+
* Pip

To maintain work environment purity, a virtual environment is recommended. I recommended taking a look at [this](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

```


## Input Files

#### Coins.json

A JSON formatted input file that run_vending_machine.py utilizes to initalize coin state.

e.g.
```
[
    {"coin_name": "nickel", "coin_value": 5, "coin_count": 10},
    {"coin_name": "dime", "coin_value": 10, "coin_count": 10},
    {"coin_name": "quarter", "coin_value": 25, "coin_count": 10}
]
```

#### Products.json

A JSON formatted input file that run_vending_machine.py utilizes to initalize product state.

e.g.
```
[
    {"product_name": "cola", "product_cost": 100},
    {"product_name": "chips", "product_cost": 50, "product_count": 10},
    {"product_name": "candy", "product_cost": 65, "product_count": 10}
]
```
## Assumptions

This is a list of assumptions that were made about the functioning of this vending machine:

* No two coins have the same value or name
* The ability to store coins and products is arbitrarily large
* Inserted coins are added to the register after a successful purchase
* All larger coins can be made with a combination of smaller coins
* EXACT CHANGE ONLY is displayed when the register is completely empty, and instead...
* A NEW DISPLAY MESSAGE WAS ADDED, "UNABLE TO MAKE CHANGE", which displays when:
 * Inserted value exceeds vending machine's ability to make change for a selected product
